# Unofficial-Bannerlord-Bug-Reporting-Repo
It's harvesting season, and we've got weevils!

If you want to contribute to the effort to squash all these bugs, I'd appreciate it if you followed this standard format (shamelessly ripped off from a guy called Leszek Gorniak on Gamasutra):

_I'd like ya'll to keep in mind that this repository is **NOT** for suggestions, proposals, or any feature requests. This is **ONLY** for actual, bona-fide glitches. I **will** remove any issue violates this without warning, and I'm entirely willing to start a **nuclear winter** over this._

For the category, title, and severity fields, I've made issue labels for those. Try to use those before making new ones. 

   - Title:
   Some descriptive label for the bug. 
   - Category:
     - Scene AI: For the troops doing strange things, townspeople not pathing right, etc.
     - Campaign AI: Lords and other parties getting glitched. This isn't for Lords making dumb decisions within the bounds of proper functioning.
     - Dialogues / Writing: Improper grammar, spelling, placeholder text, etc.
     - User Interface: Buttons not working, etc.
     - Graphics: Models, textures, post-processing, lighting...
     - Gameplay: Sort of a catch-all for anything not covered by the other categories.
   
   - Severity/Priority:
   Minor, Major, Game-breaking, Crash
   - Steps to Reproduce:
   Try to make this as detailed as possible!
   - Current Result:
   What happens now? 
   - Expected Result:
   What ought to happen? 
   - Affected Version:
     You can find the version number on the bottom left of the initial splash screen when you press "Play" in Steam.
   - Reproducibility:
   Discuss how easy/hard it is to reproduce. Is it dependent on random variables, or can it be reliably reproduced by following certain steps? 
   - Platform:
   Just Windows! Dammit, Bill!
